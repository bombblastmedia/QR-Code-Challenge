## My process

Created the Page in Figma from the design images, Then used previouse knowledge and info from the links above to build the page based on my Figma design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mainly used the project to recap on css, before starting to learn JS. most useful part was getting the card centered, using the below css.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      text-align: center;;
}
